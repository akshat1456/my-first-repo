🔹 What is DevOps?

DevOps = Development + Operations.
It’s a culture + set of practices + tools that help software developers (who write code) and operations teams (who deploy and manage code) work together smoothly.

Instead of working separately, DevOps makes them collaborate so that software is built, tested, and delivered faster, more reliable, and continuous.

🔹 Key Ideas

Automation → Code builds, testing, deployment, monitoring.

Continuous Integration (CI) → Developers keep merging code changes frequently.

Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) → Code is automatically tested and released to production.

Collaboration → Dev + Ops work as one team.

Monitoring & Feedback → Constant tracking of software in real-world use.
